        <h1><strong>Why I Look Up at Him:</strong></h1>
        <p>Growing up, I was really fond of everything related to arts. I learned how to draw, paint, and write at the age of 5. As years passed by, I became more and more obsessed with drawing that I even tried different art styles:</p>
        <li>Japanese Anime</li>
        <li>Western Cartoon</li>
        <li>Architectural Buildings</li>
        <li>Realism Portraits</li>
        <li>Landscape and Seascape Painting</li>
        <li>Animation 2D and 3D</li>
        <p>Even though I tried these different styles, his personal drawing style was stucked deep inside me. When I was around 7, our family had a book about him, and inside the book were drawings and paintings that he created. From that day, I always tried to copy his style yet my skill is miles away from him.</p>
        <p>He is my personal inspiration on why up until now, I still continue my passion in arts.</p>
