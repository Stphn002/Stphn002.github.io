          <p>The WorldWideWeb (WWW or simply the web) is a global network of interconnected documents and resources,
            accessible via the internet. It was invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in the late 1980s, and it revolutionized
            the way information is accessed an shared worldwide. The web encompasses a vast array of content, inlcuding
            web pages, images, videos, audio files, and more, all accessible through hyperlinks.</p>
          <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript are foundational
            technologies of the World Wide Web, each playing a crucial role in its operation and functionality.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>HTML - Backbone of web pages</li>
            <li>CSS - Enhances the presentaion of HTML elements</li>
            <li>JavaScript - Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Together, these three form the cornerstone of web development, enabling developers to create engaging,
            interactive, and user-friendly web experiences. By leveraging these technologies, individuals and
            organizations can publish content, share information, conduct business, and connect with users worldwide
            through the World Wide Web.</p>

        <article>
          <p>HTML, stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create and structure
            content on the World Wide Web. It consists of a series of elements or tags that define the different parts
            of a web page, such as headings, paragpraphs, links, images, forms, and more. These elements are enclosed
            within angle brackets, and most come in pairs - an opening tag and a closing tag - although some tags are
            self-closing.</p>
          <p>HTML provides the basic structure and semantics for web documents, allowing browsers to interpret and
            display the content correctly. It descirbes the hierarchy and organization of content, enabling users and
            browsers to understand the relationship between different elements on a web page. Additionally, HTML
            supports the inclusion of other types of media, such as audio, video, and interactive elements, making it
            versatile language for building various types of web content.</p>
          <p><strong>Example of a simple HTML document structure:</strong></p>
          <center><img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20210401153104/htmlstrc.PNG"></center>
          <p><strong>HTML enables developers to implement features like:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Structure</strong> - Provides a structured way to organize content on a web page by using
              elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and forms. These elements define the layout and
              heirarchy of information, making it easier for users and browsers to understand the content.</li>
            <li><strong>Semaintics</strong> - They convey meaning about the content they enclose. For example: header,
              footer, nav, article, and section. These elements provide context about the purpose and role of different
              sections within a web page, improving accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO).</li>
            <li><strong>hyperlinks</strong> - HTML supports hyperlinks, which allows users to navigate between different
              web pages and resources by clicking on a text or image.</li>
            <li><strong>Multimedia</strong> - HTML enables the integration of multimedia content such us images, videos,
              and audio files into web pages.</li>
            <li><strong>Forms</strong> - HTML provides form elements for collection of user input on web pages, These
              forms enables user to submit data such as text, numbers, and files uploads, to web servers for processing.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Integration with CSS and JavaScript</strong> - HTML seamlessly integrates with CSS and
              JavaScript to enhance the presentation and interactivity of web pages.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Overall, HTML provides a versatile and standardized way to structure and present content on the web,
            facilitating the creation of interactive and accessible web experiences for users worldwide.</p>

        <article>
          <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a powerful language used in web development to control the presentation
            and styling of HTML elements on a web page. It enables developers to define the visual appearance of
            elements including layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and more. By separating the content of a web page from
            its presentaion, CSS promotes cleaner and more maintanable code, allowing developers to make site-wide syle
            changes efficiently.</p>
          <p>CSS works by selecting HTML elements using selectors and applying styles to them through rules defined in
            style sheets. Thes styles can be specified inline within HTML elements, embedded within the 'style' element
            in HTML document, or linked from external CSS files. STyles can be targeted broadly to affect entire groups
            of elements or specifically to target individual elements based on their attributes, classes, or IDs.</p>
          <p><strong>Example of a simple CSS style:</strong></p>
          <code>
              body {
                font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
                background-color: #f4f4f4;
            }
            
            h1 {
                color: #333;
            }
            
            nav ul {
                list-style: none;
                margin: 0;
                padding: 0;
            }
            
            footer {
                background-color: #333;
                color: #fff;
                text-align: center;
                padding: 10px;
            }
            
            </code>
          <p><strong>CSS enables developers to implement features like:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Selective Targeting</strong> - CSS allows developers to target specific HTML elements, classes,
              IDs, attributes, or groups of elements using selectors.</li>
            <li><strong>Styling Properties</strong> - CSS provides a widew range of styling properties that control
              various aspects of the visual appearance of elemets like setting colors, fonts, text formats, margins,
              paddings, borders, background, and more.</li>
            <li><strong>Cascading</strong> - CSS employs a cascading heirarchy to determine the precendence of styles
              when multiple rules apply to the same element.</li>
            <li><strong>Responsive Design</strong> - Supports responsive web design techniques, allowing developers to
              create layouts that adapt and respond to different screen sizes and devices.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexibility and Control</strong> - CSS supports animation and transition effects, allowing
              developers to create visually engaging and interactive user experience without relying on JavaScript.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Overall, CSS empowers developers to create visually appealing, accessible and responsive web designs,
            enhancing the user experience and usability if websites and web applications.</p>

        <header>What is JavaScript</header>
        <article>
          <p>JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used for creating interactive and dynamic web
            content. As one of the core technologies of web alongside HTML anc CSS, JavaScript runs on the client side,
            meaning, it executes within the user's web page, respond to user actions, and update content dynamically
            without requiring a page refresh.</p>
          <p>JavaScript capabilities extend beyond web development, as it's also used in various other environments such
            as server-side development, mobile app development, and desktop application development. However, its
            significance on the web lies in its ability to enhance the user experience through interactivity.</p>
          <p><strong>Example of a simple JavaScript script:</strong></p>
          <code>// Simple alert when the page loads
              window.onload = function() {
                  alert("Welcome to our website!");
              }
              
              // Example of handling a button click
              function displayMessage() {
                  var message = "Button clicked!";
                  console.log(message);
                  alert(message);
              }
              </code>
          <p><strong>JavaScript enables developers to implement features like:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Client-Side Scripting</strong> - avaScript runs on the client side, meaning it executes within
              the user's web browser. This enables JavaScript to manipulate the HTML and CSS of a web page, respond to
              user actions, and update content dynamically without requiring a page refresh.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Typing</strong> - JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning variables can hold values of
              any data type without explicit declaration. This flexibility allows for rapid development and easy
              adaptation to changing requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Functional Programming Features</strong> - JavaScript supports functional programming paradigms
              such as first-class functions, higher-order functions, and closures. Functions can be passed as arguments
              to other functions, returned from functions, or assigned to variables, allowing for elegant and concise
              code.</li>
            <li><strong>DOM Manipulation</strong> - JavaScript provides powerful APIs for interacting with the Document
              Object Model (DOM), which represents the structure and content of a web page. Developers can manipulate
              DOM elements, handle events, modify styles, and create interactive user interfaces dynamically using
              JavaScript.</li>
            <li><strong>Server-Side Development</strong> - With the introduction of Node.js, JS can now also be used for
              server-side development. Node.js enables developers to build scalable and high-performance web servers
              using JavaScript, facilitating full-stack development with a unified language and toolset.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Overall, JavaScript's versatility, flexibility, and widespread adoption make it an essential tool for web
            development, enabling developers to create interactive, responsive, and feature-rich web experiences for
            users worldwide.</p>
